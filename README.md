## Gravity

A game exploring the Unity gaming engine and hand spun physics.

#### TODO:
- [ ] Sound effects
- [ ] Particle explosions on collisions
- [ ] Damper should apply outward force against asteroids as well.
- [ ] Bug: Astroid collision intersections sometimes cause asteroids to clump together
- [ ] Display energy bars for weapon, shield, thrusters, and damper
- [ ] Add Force field, impacts reduce shield energy
- [ ] Weapon, thruster, and dampender uses energy
- [ ] Energy restores over time
- [ ] Energy allocation system
