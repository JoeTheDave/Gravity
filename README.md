- [ ] ??? What does it look like when the camera rotates with the ship rotation so the ship always points up ???
- [ ] Sound effects
- [ ] Particle explosions on collisions
- [ ] Bug: Astroid collision intersections sometimes cause asteroids to clump together
- [ ] Display energy bars for weapon, shield, thrusters, and damper
- [ ] Add Force field, impacts reduce shield energy
- [ ] Weapon, thruster, and dampender uses energy
- [ ] Energy restores over time
- [ ] Energy allocation system
